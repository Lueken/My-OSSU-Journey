# My OSSU Computer Science Journey

This repository tracks my progress through the [OSSU Computer Science curriculum](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science).

## About OSSU
The OSSU curriculum provides a complete computer science education using free online courses from top universities. It's designed to match undergraduate CS degree requirements (minus general education) and is ideal for self-motivated learners.
